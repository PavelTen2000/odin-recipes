    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in
         just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or 
         weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even 
         faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), 
         however use what you have on hand.</p>

         <ul>
            <li> â…“ cup water</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
         </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and 
                ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high
                 heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has 
                 reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly 
                    oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto 
                    skewers and place on a platter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per
                     side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn 
                     grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers.
                      Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro
                       and sesame seeds.
